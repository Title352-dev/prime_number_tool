# about this program
I (Title352-dev) create this program with my self and ChatGPT. I use to learn Python from start. by create before I have Github accout. In really I have other version but they don't stable. example:
##    check continuously number every 1
check by use all found prime number.
##    check continuously number only odd number
by start at 3 and add 2 in other number. becouse it have only one prime number is even number, that is 2.
##    check odd number, and check until found prime number power of 2 is over suspicious number.
becouse that mean the suspicions number will can divided by any prime number. (this version)
##    pararal calculate 4 suspicions number in same time by start at 11,13,17,19 .
becouse lower that those number will are 2,3,5,7 be prime number but 2 and 5 are spaicel prime number becouse 2 are only one prime number is even number, and 5 is only one prime number has end with 5.
